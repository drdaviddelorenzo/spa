# spa
a tool for analysis of spatial structure in genetics data

Recently, we did a major update for SPA. Now it is much faster than before by using multi-threading library, without any change of the command line arguments

We use `cmake`(https://cmake.org/) as our build system. We also use `boost`(http://www.boost.org/) as dependencies. Please install both `cmake` and `boost` for complilation.

Please run the below commands to build executable

```
mkdir build; cd build;
cmake ..
```

Enjoy!
